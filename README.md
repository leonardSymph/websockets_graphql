# for portfolio purposes only

# front-end and back-end separate
- react
- node
- express
- mongodb
- socket.io
- graphql
- jsonwebtoken
- bcrypt

seprated both because I was doing each of them separately that time
and just connected both of them

# to start
# for each folder
```
npm install
npm start
```
